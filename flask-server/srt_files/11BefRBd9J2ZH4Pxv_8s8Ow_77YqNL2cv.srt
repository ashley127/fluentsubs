1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 The video you're about to watch has no redstone dust, no redstone torches,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 no redstone blocks, no redstone repeaters, and no redstone comparators,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 because in this video we're going to be using the brand new redstone component

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 introduced in this week's snapshot, the wind charge.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Now you may be asking yourself, Crafty, how the hell is the wind charge a redstone component?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Most of you probably know it for its movement-based properties.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 For example, I can scale up this mountain just using a few breeze balls,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 and there you go, I can get to the top. And since they're a projectile, you can also fire them

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 from dispensers. So you can basically make a bunch of different player cannons like this. So I've kind of made like this little obstacle

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 course. So we're going to try and run through it without failing. Surely. So first, we hop on this

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 platform. As you can see, you also take no fall damage when you use the wind charge.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 So now we're going to try, aim for that platform. There we go. Come on, get it, land on it.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 And then we get our button and our other wind charge, even though I already have one.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 You can also clutch with these if you time it right, so I hope I do this first try because I'm not very good at it.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 And...

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Which means, of course, we're're gonna get it second try surely there you go we

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 can clutch it with the wind charges so I'm gonna try and get in there come on there we

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 go we place our buttonore that one piece of redstone dust.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And finally we launch ourselves to the final platform.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 All the way up to the gold over here.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 So this is just a small taste of what you can do movement base,

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 so you can probably make way more elaborate courses using these wind charges.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 But another thing you may not know about them

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 is that they can actually interact with all of these different blocks right here.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 So if I throw a wind charge at all of these, as you can see, the fence gate opens, the lever gets flicked,

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 trapdoor can also open.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Button gets pushed.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Also doors can open.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Bells can get rung.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And also candles can actually get extinguished.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 So if I light this again, you can see that they're lit, and then you can turn them off like this.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And the activation range for this is like roughly like two blocks away in like a circle like

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 this. It's a little bit random because it's a projectile and has a little bit of random motion.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 But yeah, two block radius is roughly the activation range.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 So one of the first things I tried was making a screen that you can also draw on.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 So as you can see, all you have to do is just kind of fire the balls roughly where you want to paint. And look, you can make a smiley face just like that. And you can also erase it. If you kind of do it, again, it's not the most consistent.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 And that is the problem with a lot of these very small drawable screens. They can't really be

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 reset too easily. Of course, until now.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Because if you happen to use trap doors,

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 instead of copper bulbs with buttons on top of them,

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 you can both draw on the trap doors like this.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 So again, let's make a really derpy looking smiley face that looks like it's on a snowman.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 But you can also reset the screen right over there, as you can see all the trap doors get pulsed and the screen gets

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 white. And the redstone back here is so simple. It's literally just a wall with some trap

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 doors with just a bunch of observer spam that activates all the track doors and it's just powered by this other

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 trapdoor which you can also shoot one of these wind charges at. I'm not going to lie, I don't

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 know how much the name wind charge is going to stick. I think Breeze Ball is a way better name for it.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 I mean, we already have the Blaze Rod, so it kind of makes sense to have the Breeze balls.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Wait a minute. Moving away from questionable jokes, you can also make piston doors using these.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 So as you can see, if you throw the wind charge, I'm going to be calling the breeze balls

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 for the rest of this video.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 As you can see, you can activate two levers at the same time.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Now, that is, if you put it in the middle.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 If you do it even slightly off to one side,

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 it's not gonna be the most consistent.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 You have to make sure you hit it dead on

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 in the center for it to work consistently. Which is why you can

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 automate the process even more by dispensing the breeze balls from dispensers. So here we

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 have a very basic 3x3 door with a hole in the middle.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 That gets activated by this kind of like increasing cone shape of dispensers.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 So as you can see in the very front layer, we have all of our levers that activate all of these

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 pistons,

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 and then they get powered by these dispensers with these breeze balls,

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 and then you kind of make these as close together as you can,

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 so all of these buttons are nice and close,

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 so then you can have another pair of dispensers activate these buttons are nice and close, so then you can have another pair of dispensers activate

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 these buttons. So then you just kind of get like a chain reaction, and you get a very basic

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 piston door. But obviously only using single piston extenders is pretty limiting, so the next thing

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I wanted to do was a double piston extender.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 So here is one version over here.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Look at it.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 It's beautiful.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Basically, this button powers these sets of back pistons, and then the breeze ball gets dispensed, and then it hits this lever like this, and then it stays on, and then on retraction, it also hits this button, which will activate the pistons and do the final

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 retraction.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Just like that.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 So combining normal pistons with a double piston extender, the first Breeze Ball

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 base door I made was the 4x4 Vault Door.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Now Breeze Ball Door is kinda hard to say.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 There's a lot of consonant sounds and I don't really like it.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 So what's the best way to describe a door in which the jobs of activating all the levers is done by blowing them.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 The blowjob door.

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 So if we look at the wiring for a bit, you can see over here we have the double piston extender from before,

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 just slightly oriented a little differently, but we still have the button here, the lever,

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 and the last button for the retraction. And then the rest is kind of just wiring that goes all around

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 the door to activate these outer pistons. Okay, so double piston extenders may be able to take

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 us to vault doors like this with two layers, but what if you still want to make a normal 3x3? Well, it'd probably be

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 beneficial to have some one-tick generators. That's right, we have a one-tick generator over here.

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 It is very small, and it just

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 uses two dispensers full of

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 breeze balls. One is right up

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 against this block, and the other is kind of

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 like one block away. So we get

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 two ball collisions,

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 but the collisions are just spaced out enough

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 where it only gives a one-tick pulse.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 So this lever kind of gets spammed

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 on and off very quickly, just like that.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 So now that we have double piss extenders and one tick pulses,

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 the next step is obviously a 3x3 piston door.

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 This is the 3x3 BJ door.

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Look at it. Look how beautiful it is. It is very complicated. I mean, I can try my

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 best to explain it, but I don't expect any of you to understand. So the first part is the Piston Layout.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 This is the Piston Layout for the middle three blocks, and it goes a little something like this.

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 So first, this double piston extender on the bottom, extends like this, then it pushes there, and then it kind of stays here.

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 So then we have this bottom block of the 3x3.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Then the top part goes off and we get a one tick pulse here, we kind of get like a button

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 pulse on this piston, and then a second one tick pulse here, we kind of get like a button pulse on this piston, and then a second one tick

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 pulse on this piston again. And there you go, we have the closing. God damn it, I can't avoid

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 references to these. And then on the opening, we just do the double piston extension again, except this time

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 it'll actually push the blocks up here, this piston retracts that block, this piston

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 retracts this, and finally the double piston extender retracts back into the ground.

112
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 So we can see that in the double when we push the button.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 As you can see it pushed all the way up, and then it retracted only once, leaving this bottom block.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 And then on the opening, you can see that it's going to push all the blocks into the ceiling.

115
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And then again, to get the sticky piston to spit out its block,

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 we have two one-tick generators because this thing has to fire twice.

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 There is one more interesting property about these kinds of doors though.

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 So if we just look at the closing one more time,

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 as you can see, this piston actually stays extended,

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 but there are no inputs on it.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 The reason is because we have this button over here

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 and this button on top activating the one tick generator.

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 So this activates it, and then this keeps the powered on

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 because of quasi connectivity.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Which means when this double piston extender pushes the block in front of this piston,

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 it's going to be able to instantly retract without us even putting an input.

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 So that means on the opening, we actually only need one one tick pulse instead of two one

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 tick pulses. So we have this lever over here, which basically means that when it's on, which is

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 when it's closed, it's going to power the top section. But when it's on, which is when it's closed,

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 it's going to power the top section.

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 But when it opens, this lever will turn off,

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 meaning the dispenser won't actually fire in the opening.

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 So we can see that happening right here.

134
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 As you can see, the lever turned off, and this part of the door never got powered. If you want to see the lever logic more clearly, we have like a setup over here.

135
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 The middle lamp will activate every time I push this button, and the side lamps will

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 alternate.

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 So right now the right lamp just went on, and now the left lamp will go on, and then again, the right lamp will go on.

138
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 So that is how you can have like an on and off edge pulse kind of thing on a button input like this.

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 So now what if we combine to all of the knowledge of our double piston extenders,

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 our one-tick pulses, and our newfound lever logic?

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Well, we get the world's first 4x4 BJ door.

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 And as you can see, this thing looks insane.

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 It's like shattering into like lots of tiny pieces as it gets further.

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And yes, it does have to be this big.

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And another thing, it's pretty unreliable, so hopefully it works the first time I push it.

146
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 So there we go. The door will close.

147
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Nicely like that and is actually in sync, which is pretty rare.

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 And let's see if it opens.

149
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 There we go.

150
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 And now the double piss and extenders are gonna go off.

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 And there you go.

152
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 The 4x4 has opened.

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 So I also went ahead and took this angle from the door, just so you can see all the pistons

154
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 and all the breeze balls hitting all the levers and buttons.

155
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Am I going to explain how this works? Probably not, since it is really complicated,

156
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 but it does use that lever logic we just talked about to control the double piston

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 extender on the opening and only power the back pistons on the closing.

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 You guys also have no idea how many takes it took me to open this door.

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Because the thing is, this is hella unreliable, especially this dispenser over here.

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 This thing fires a breeze ball.

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Sometimes it doesn't hit that platform

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 and it just flies past.

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 So yeah, that is the end of Crafty Masterman

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 making yet another snapshot video

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 and giving the latest component a really stupid name.

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Hopefully, like the other two times, it doesn't get nerved into oblivion.
