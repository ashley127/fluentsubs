1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 You wanted to come this time. Tia

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Bona!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Little fists!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Big sis!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 You were gone forever!

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 It was three days.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Where are we going?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Before Maui stole Tifiti's heart,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 our ancestors wanted to connect our island

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 to all the people of the entire ocean.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 It's my job as a wavefinder to finish what they started.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Wanna show how people?

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Just how far we'll go.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 This is a call from the ancestors.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Hidden in a terrible storm.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 It's an ancient island.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Sitting foot on its sands would break the curse.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Bring our people together again.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 They know what I have to do.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Mowie, I could really use your help.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Can I get a Chi-hoo?

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 You will be destroyed and your Wayfinder too.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Now I kind of miss the lava monster

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 ow

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 what if you don't come back

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 I'll be back I promise don't come back.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 I'll be back.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I promise.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Do I hear people?

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Those aren't people. Cockham, aura.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 You guys, we got this.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Whoa!

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Whoa! Oh!

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Bring it on, Coke.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Nuts.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Saving a high mind. Hsu'Hi! SIEG!

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Ho!
