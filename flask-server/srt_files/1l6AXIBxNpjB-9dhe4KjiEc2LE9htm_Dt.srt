1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 You wanted to come this time.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Zay-in-pah!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Little Fis!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Big Tis!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 You were gone forever!

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 It was three days.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Where are we going?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Before Mali stole Tifiti's heart.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Our ancestors,

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 I wanted to connect our island to all the people of the entire ocean.

11
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 It's my job as a wavefinder to finish what they started.

12
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Wanna show how people?

13
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Just how far we'll go.

14
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 This is a call from the ancestors.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Hidden in a terrible storm.

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 It's an ancient island.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Sitting foot on its sands would break the curse.

18
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Bring our people together again.

19
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 I know what I have to do.

20
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Mowie, I could really use your help.

21
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Can I get a Chi-hoo?

22
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 You will be destroyed.

23
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 And your wayfinder too.

24
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Now I kind of miss the lava monster.

25
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Ow!

26
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Ow!

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 What if you don't come back?

28
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 I'll be back.

29
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 I promise.

30
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Do I hear people?

31
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Those aren't people.

32
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Cockham.

33
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Yeah.

34
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 You guys, we got this.

35
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Oh, whoa!

36
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Bring it on, Coke.

37
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Nuts.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Go!

39
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 See, I'm in my mind.

40
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Super!

41
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Woo!
